Hello there,

These are times when [personal blogs](#) are easily overlooked due to the high rise of online publishing platforms (Medium anyone?) that make your [ideas](#), [solutions](#), or [just thoughts](#) only a drop in the ocean of information.

But I like to think of this as my [personal repo](#), so let's call it [zalom's repo](#)!

I will share [my point/s of view](#) here, and I hope you will find some value in all of it.

So,

{% highlight ruby lineanchors %}
puts 'Welcome everyone!'
{% endhighlight %}
